## About Corpusim 

- Helps you comprehend the complexities of anatomy and physiology with direct interaction in 3D Environments - zooming in from organ systems to organelles. parametric geometry allows infinite exploration of procedurally-generated environments.
- Reinvents the plastic anatomical models and textbook illustrations of the past. More than a simple digital transfer of those tools, interactive simulations and living data produce an experience that is magnitudes greater.
- Incorporates the latest data from any laboratory that has a public interface - or use your own data. Corpusim grows its simulation capability in step with the data it accesses. 
- Is a public good by its legal license. We are building a world-class tool that will be forever available where and for whom it's needed.
